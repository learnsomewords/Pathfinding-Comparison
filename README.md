# Pathfinding-Comparison

## Map Creation
1. Press ‘s’ or ‘S’ and left click one block on the grid to create a start point. 
2. Press ‘e’ or ‘E’ and left click one block on the grid to create a endpoint.
3. Left click and drag the mouse can draw barriers
4. Unwanted start point, endpoint and barriers can be cancle right clicking (plus 'e', 'E', 's', or 'S')

## Chosing Algorithms
a drop-down list provides five algorithms to choose.

## Visualization and Speed
If visulization is checked, speed bar can be modified so users can visualize algorithms in a comfortable speed.

## Values for Performance Comparison
If visualization is turned off, three values will show up. The computed blocks, the length of the path and the time consumed.

However, if the visualization turned on the time will not show up.

## Acknowledgement
Some of the code of this project are based on the code from https://github.com/DevonCrawford/A-Pathfinding-Visualization
His project only visulized A* algorithm and some of the code for visualization is used in our project. However, in our project, four new algorithms are added and some functions are deleted or added based on the needs.
