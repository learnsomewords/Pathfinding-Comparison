# Pathfinding-Comparison
Holding "s" and left click for start point.
Holding "e" and left click for end point.
Clear cannot clear border but can clear path, close node and open node.
It will show time if visualisation is unchecked.
It will show the speed if visualisation is checked



add more algorithms based on the project from DevonCrawford
https://github.com/DevonCrawford/A-Pathfinding-Visualization

He implemented A* algorithm

DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, Greed and A* algorithms all can work in this program.
